# DS4
The BigSupplyCo. project was executed using Google Colab. The dataset for this project was provided by the DS-4 platform and includes five datasets, namely product, category, order, customer, and department. These datasets contain valuable information about customers, order countries, product categories, product departments, delivery status, geographical details, and more.
In this data set we need to imagine the retail sphere as a set of customer segments, each with unique characteristics and behaviors. The challenge delves into the dynamics of customer retention, analyzing the factors that bind shoppers to brands and unveiling strategies to enhance loyalty.

Used libraries are:

import pandas as pd

import numpy as np

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import seaborn as sns

and Python codes
